The goal of this project is to develop an AI agent that is able to assist a player
in a blackjack game. It primarily involves two components: first, a computer vision
system that serves as the agent’s eyes to recognize cards, and second, a decision-making
mechanism to determine the most profitable move for the agent. The first component
was achieved by using a light and yet quite effective approach, leveraging OpenCV’s
powerful features, in particular cv2, while the latter utilizes reinforcement learning, in
particular Q-learning and deep Q-learning.
